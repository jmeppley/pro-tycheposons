Supplementary code and data for our manuscripts "Novel integrative elements and genomic plasticity in ocean ecosystems" describing Tycheposons - a new class of mobile genetic elements in /Prochlorococcus/ and other marine bacteria that are abundant in marine vesicles and viruses.

See
- =element-finder/bin= for the scripts to predict the mobile elements in genomic data.
- =element-finder/data= for the profiles of signature genes.
- =elements-pro= for elements in /Prochlorococcus/.
- =elements-gorg-single-cells= for elements in other marine bacteria.
- =elements-tara-viral= for elements found in  Tara Oceans viral-fraction metagenome assemblies.
- =data-pro= for reference-scaffolded and annotated /Prochlorococcus/ genomes and a phylogenetic tree.
- =MIT0604-nanopore= for the nanopore assemblies of /Prochlorococcus/ strain MIT0604 containing copies of a mobile element carrying a nitrate assimilation
  gene cluster.
- =rnaseq-pro= for differential gene expression analysis of /Prochlorococcus/ with focus on element response
- =YR-phylogeny= for sequences, alignment and phylogenetic tree of tyrosine recombinases.
- =vesicles-abundance= for differential abundance analysis of element hallmark genes in vesicles
