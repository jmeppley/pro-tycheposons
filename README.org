Supplementary code and data for our manuscripts describing a new class of mobile
genetic elements in /Prochlorococcus/ and other marine bacteria that are
abundant in marine vesicles and viruses.

See =element-finder/bin= for the scripts to predict the mobile elements in genomic data.
See =element-finder/data= for the profiles of signature genes.
See =elements-pro= for elements in /Prochlorococcus/.
See =elements-gorg-single-cells= for elements in other marine bacteria.
See =elements-tara-viral= for elements found in  Tara Oceans viral-fraction metagenome assemblies.
